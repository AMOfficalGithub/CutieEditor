# CutieEditor

A TextEditor that supports .NET Console applications including WPF, ASP.Net, Angular and CLI programs.

  Key Features for the TextEditor:

    Syntax Highlighting: Supports syntax highlighting for various .NET-related languages like C#, ASP.NET (HTML, Razor), XAML (WPF), and more.
    IntelliSense / Autocompletion: Provides code suggestions and autocompletion, especially for .NET frameworks and libraries.
    Project/Workspace Management: Enables the user to handle multiple projects or files efficiently. This would support .NET console applications, WPF, ASP.NET, and CLI-based applications.
    Integrated Debugging and Testing: Provides debugging capabilities and integration with .NET test frameworks (e.g., MSTest, NUnit, xUnit).
    Version Control Integration: Incorporates version control (e.g., Git, Subversion) to manage source code and collaborate.
    Cross-platform: If needed, the editor should ideally be cross-platform to support Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    Extensibility: The editor should allow you to extend functionality with plugins, especially if you're targeting specific .NET libraries or tools.
    UI Design Support for WPF: For WPF applications, having an integrated XAML designer or previewer would be helpful for a visual layout of the user interface.
    Support for Building and Running: The editor should support building and running your applications directly, handling build configurations, or integrating with MSBuild or dotnet CLI commands.
