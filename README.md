# CutieEditor
A TextEditor that supports .NET Console applications including WPF, ASP.Net and CLI programs.

    Choose a Development Environment:
    You can use Visual Studio. These tools provide excellent support for .NET development.

    Create a New Project:
    Start by creating a new .NET project. You can choose between different project types depending on your needs:

        Windows Forms Application: If you prefer a desktop-based text editor with a graphical user interface (GUI), you can choose a Windows Forms Application project.

    Implement Text Editing Features:
    Regardless of the project type, you'll need to implement text editing features. You can use the System.IO namespace to read and write text files. For more advanced text editing capabilities, you might want to explore third-party libraries or build your own functionality.

    Windows Forms Application:
    If you choose a Windows Forms Application, you can design a GUI for your text editor using drag-and-drop tools available in Visual Studio. You can use text boxes or rich text boxes for text editing. Implement buttons for actions like opening, saving, and editing files.

    File Handling:
    In all cases, you'll need to implement file handling operations like opening, saving, and editing text files. The System.IO namespace in C# is useful for this purpose.

    Advanced Features:
    Depending on your requirements, you can add features like syntax highlighting, search and replace, cut/copy/paste functionality, and more to enhance your text editor's capabilities.

    Testing:
    Thoroughly test your text editor to ensure it functions correctly in each environment (console, web, or desktop).

    Deployment:
    Deploy your text editor to the appropriate environment. For console applications, there's no deployment; for web applications, you'll need a web server, and for Windows Forms applications, you can create an installer.

Remember to consider the specific requirements and design of your text editor for each platform carefully. The choice between a console, web, or desktop application depends on your target audience and the features you want to provide.
